Chatrooms

When working with a specific chatroom, the chatroom can be identified by its 'id'. Currently, you can create a chatroom with any id and other users will be able to join the chatroom.

Since chatrooms are used in many places throughout the app and each implementation has its own business logic, the chatrooms 'id' should be in the format "#{type}_#{id}".

Example chatroom ids are: "GameRoom_518347c44e6d46c840000010" and "Stream_5143b3544e6d46ee3d00000d"

The current chatroom types exist:
Dispute
Game
GameRoom
Private
Stream
